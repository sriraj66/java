Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose
value is greater than all of its prior elements.
Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.
For example,
Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}
As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.
8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.
Since total of 3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.
Hence the output = 3.
Example 1:
Input
5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
7-> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
8-> Value of Arr[2]
2-> Value of Arr[3]
9-> Value of Arr[4]
Output :
3
Example 2:
5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
3 -> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
5 -> Value of Arr[2]
8 -> Value of Arr[3]
9 -> Value of Arr[4]
Output :
5

1.Problem Statement

A washing machine works on the principle of Fuzzy System, the weight of clothes put
inside it for washing is uncertain But based on weight measured by sensors, it decides
time and water level which can be changed by menus given on the machine control
area.

For low level water, the time estimate is 25 minutes, where approximately weight is
between 2000 grams or any nonzero positive number below that.
For medium level water, the time estimate is 35 minutes, where approximately weight
is between 2001 grams and 4000 grams.
For high level water, the time estimate is 45 minutes, where approximately weight is
above 4000 grams.

Assume the capacity of machine is maximum 7000 grams
Where approximately weight is zero, time estimate is 0 minutes.
Write a function which takes a numeric weight in the range [0,7000] as input and
produces estimated time as output is: “OVERLOADED”, and for all other inputs, the
output statement is


“INVALID INPUT”.
Input should be in the form of integer value –
Output must have the following format –
Time Estimated: Minutes
Example:
Input value
2000
Output value
Time Estimated: 25 minutes

2.problem statement

There is a JAR full of candies for sale at a mall counter. JAR has the
capacity N, that is JAR can contain maximum N candies when JAR is full. At
any point of time. JAR can have M number of Candies where M<=N. Candies
are served to the customers. JAR is never remain empty as when last k
candies are left. JAR if refilled with new candies in such a way that JAR get
full.

Write a code to implement above scenario. Display JAR at counter with
available number of candies. Input should be the number of candies one
customer can order at point of time. Update the JAR after each purchase and
display JAR at Counter.

• Output should give number of Candies sold and updated number of Candies
in JAR.
• If Input is more than candies in JAR, return: “INVALID INPUT”
Given,
N=10, where N is NUMBER OF CANDIES AVAILABLE
K =< 5, where k is number of minimum candies that must be inside JAR ever.


Example 1:(N = 10, k =< 5)
• Input Value
3
Output Value
NUMBER OF CANDIES SOLD : 3
NUMBER OF CANDIES AVAILABLE : 7

• Example : (N=10, k<=5)
• Input Value
0
Output Value
INVALID INPUT NUMBER OF
CANDIES LEFT : 10

3.problem statement

Selection of MPCS exams include a fitness test which is conducted on ground.
There will be a batch of 3 trainees, appearing for running test in track for 3 rounds.
You need to record their oxygen level after every round. After trainee are finished
with all rounds, calculate for each trainee his average oxygen level over the 3 rounds
and select one with highest oxygen level as the most fit trainee. If more than one
trainee attains the same highest average level, they all need to be selected.
Display the most fit trainee (or trainees) and the highest average oxygen level.

Note:
• The oxygen value entered should not be accepted if it is not in the range between 1
and 100.
• If the calculated maximum average oxygen value of trainees is below 70 then declare the
trainees as unfit with meaningful message as “All trainees are unfit.
• Average Oxygen Values should be rounded.

Example 1:
INPUT VALUES
95
92
95
92
90
92
90
92
90

OUTPUT VALUES
Trainee Number : 1
Trainee Number : 3
Note:
Input should be 9 integer values representing oxygen levels entered in order as
Round 1
• Oxygen value of trainee 1
• Oxygen value of trainee 2
• Oxygen value of trainee 3
Round 2
• Oxygen value of trainee 1
• Oxygen value of trainee 2
• Oxygen value of trainee 3
Round 3
• Oxygen value of trainee 1
• Oxygen value of trainee 2
• Oxygen value of trainee 3
Output must be in given format as in above example. For any wrong input final
output should display “INVALID INPUT"

A doctor has a clinic where he serves his patients. The doctor’s consultation fees 
are different for different groups of patients depending on their age. If the 
patient’s age is below 17, fees is 200 INR. If the patient’s age is between 17 and 
40, fees is 400 INR. If patient’s age is above 40, fees is 300 INR. Write a code to 
calculate earnings in a day for which one array/List of values representing age of 
patients visited on that day is passed as input.
Note:
• Age should not be zero or less than zero or above 120
• Doctor consults a maximum of 20 patients a day
• Enter age value (press Enter without a value to stop):
Example 1:
Input
20
30
40
50

3
14
Output
Total Income 2000 INR

Note: Input and Output Format should be same as given in the above example.
For any wrong input display INVALID INPUT
Output Format
Total Income 2100 INR
